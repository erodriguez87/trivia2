## Simple Javascript Trivia Game

This game is works after clicking the start button.

It uses a set of functions to call questions and answers from arrays inside of an object. These items are passed into a bootstrap panel and each answer is turned into a clickable div. 

Once a user clicks on a div the response is stored and compared against the correct answer. This also triggers the card to leave and a new question to come up.
